# standard-calculator

<strong><em>What I learned?</em></strong>
This project was especially difficult to design in terms of implementing the javascript necessary in order to support the intended functionality of the calculator. After failing a lot, I decided to review an already existing approach as to develop the common sense fundamentals needed to tackle a problem like this. 

Through this, I was able to come up with so many insights that I could not begin to think of before review . For example,there is a defer atrribute that can be used in your script tag in order to achieve the same functionality as positioning your script tag in the body. This atrribute allows the javascript to be dowloanded in parallel with the page, and executed only after the page is parsed. 

I also began to understand how data atrributes is to javascript DOM manipulation as class attribute is to CSS DOM manipulation. Without really understanding this, working on the javascript portion while trying to work with the DOM becomes impossible if you don't know any other methods.

Lastly, I was able to see how a design approach plays an important problem in solving a problem. This particular approach focused on object orientated programming through class creation in order to support the calculator functionality. Thought it was not limited to just this. There were several areas throught the code implementation that complemented the intial OOP approach. Understanding this was important because without it, it would be really difficult to understand the varying levels of abstractness that may be present. For example, you need to understand that a method is associated with an object while a function is not. Then you need to understand how this. scope works differently with methods and functions in terms of local or global. With this, you can use arrow functions that maintain the integry of the ideal this. scope usage that will beneficial for the initial approach. 

These are not the kind of things I was thinking about before hand, but now that I'm aware of them; that will change for future projects.
